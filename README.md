Dynamic Button Remover
Description
This project provides a dynamic button removal feature implemented using JavaScript. When buttons with the class "myBtns" are clicked, they are removed from the Document Object Model (DOM). The JavaScript code selects all buttons with the class "myBtns", adds event listeners to each button, and removes the clicked button from the DOM. After removal, it updates the list of buttons and logs the current list to the console.
